# Information for the sponsor

Before an event happens, we send out a couple of information to the sponsor.
Below you will find a template.

Hey [CONTACT],

First of all: Thanks a lot that you will be the sponsor for the Web Engineering Aachen at `[DAY]`, `[MONTH DATE]` [YEAR] [1]. Such events would not be possible without you.
Up to now, `[REGISTERED USERS]` people have registered.

Here is a bit of additional information:

* We will have `[COUNT TALKS]` talk
  * `[TALK TOPIC]` - by [SPEAKER]
* Thank you for providing the drinks! It is always good to care for the well-being of the visitors.
* We will inform the speaker that the projector has `[CONNECTOR 1]` and `[CONNECTOR 2]` connector

Time table:
18:30 - 19:00: Arrival, get a drink and socialize
19:00 - 19:10: Welcome
19:10 - ~19:45: Talk + Q&A

One of the organizer will be arrive before the event offically starts. Probably 18:00 or 18:15.

If you need a list of the registered members for your security checks, please contact us in an appropiate time (24h before the event start would be great).

Does your location have special entrances or is not easy to find? Let us know so we can inform our members!

If you have any questions left, just ping us.

Otherwise, we will see each other at the Meetup at `[DAY], [MONTH DATE] [YEAR]`.
Looking forward to it!

All the best,
Niels
